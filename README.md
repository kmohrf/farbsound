# Farbsound
**this application is not maintained. the last changes were made to make the application build**

farbsound is an audio web player that takes its playlist from the site you visit

## Motivation

This project was my first attempt of writing actual vanilla JS code after tinkering a lot with jQuery. It
doesn’t really reflect my current approach that I’d take if I had to implement it again, but hey… it still works!
